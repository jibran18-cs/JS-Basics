// We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a certain time later. That’s called “scheduling a call”.

// There are two methods for it:

//1--- setTimeout() allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.
//2--- setInterval() allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

//(Important) These methods are not a part of core JavaScript specification. But most environments have the internal scheduler and provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js(These methods/functions are part of APIs).

    document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML= 'Best JS practice'
